This Hospital Management System project uses Python with Tkinter for a graphical user interface and SQL (MySQL) for data storage. It aims to streamline hospital operations by providing modules for patient registration and record management, doctor profiles and scheduling, appointment booking and tracking processing, inventory management. The Tkinter GUI will provide user-friendly forms and displays for these functions, while Python code will handle data validation, execute SQL queries to interact with the database, and generate reports.  The SQL database will store information about patients, doctors, appointments, bills, and inventory, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval.  Key considerations include user experience, data validation, security, error handling, and modular design for maintainability.
It includes essential features like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing patient records.
