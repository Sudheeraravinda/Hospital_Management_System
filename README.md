The Hospital Management System is a simple desktop application built using Python (Tkinter) for GUI and SQLite for database management. It allows hospital staff to efficiently manage patient records, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting patient details.
It aims to streamline hospital operations by providing modules for patient registration and record management, doctor profiles and scheduling, appointment booking and tracking processing, inventory management. The Tkinter GUI will provide user-friendly forms and displays for these functions, while Python code will handle data validation, execute SQL queries to interact with the database, and generate reports.  The SQL database will store information about patients, doctors, appointment and inventory, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval.  Key considerations include user experience, data validation, security, error handling, and modular design for maintainability.
